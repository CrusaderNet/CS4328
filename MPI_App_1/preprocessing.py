#Now, let's write the MPI Python script that will distribute the data preprocessing tasks:

from mpi4py import MPI
import numpy as np

def preprocess_data(rank):
    # Load the data file corresponding to this rank
    data = np.load(f'data_{rank}.npy')

    # Do some preprocessing: subtract mean and divide by standard deviation
    data = (data - np.mean(data)) / np.std(data)

    # Save the preprocessed data
    np.save(f'preprocessed_data_{rank}.npy', data)

def main():
    comm = MPI.COMM_WORLD
    rank = comm.Get_rank()

    preprocess_data(rank)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()

#This script will distribute the data preprocessing tasks across the processes. Each process will load a data file, preprocess the data, and save the preprocessed data to a new file.
#
#This example is a simple demonstration of how to use MPI in a machine-learning context. In a more advanced use case, you might distribute the data preprocessing, model training, and prediction tasks. MPI can also be combined with other libraries and tools to build more complex distributed computing systems.
